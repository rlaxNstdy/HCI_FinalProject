Introduction

- In this project, WhyError will apply our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop an interactive web application with a focus on user-centered design principles. The project aims to provide our group with hands-on experience in creating a functional and user-friendly web application while applying the principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) learned during the course.

Prototype

- The prototype of the website Homie is designed for a seamless property search experience. Aiming to redefine how users buy and sell homes. The prototype's modern UI and responsive design set the stage for a user-friendly and engaging platform. With ongoing iterations to enhance functionality and user experience from buying their dream house as well as selling their house with help from our agents or posting the property by themselves via our website.

Problem Analysis

- We created Homie as a real estate website because we saw people have problems when they want to sell or buy a house. People usually rely on adverts which there are a lot of when searching for a house, they usually find this information from the advertising banners that are posted around or near the area of ​​the housing that is being sold. Once they see the banners, they have to contact the number and do the other process when buying the house. If someone wants to sell their house they have to contact the expert to advertise the property. However, because they only advertise the house without providing complete information about the property and someone decides they want to make a purchase they have to contact the agent who advertised it and not the property owner/seller which makes it quite inefficient. 

- With Homie, buying and selling houses will be very easy. When you want to buy a house, Homie will provide a variety of suitable houses. Once you have chosen a house, Homie will immediately connect you to the owner/seller of the house. If you want to sell your property, Homie will give you two options. One is using the agency that Homie has provided to help or you can advertise just by posting it through our website.
